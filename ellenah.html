<hi><strong>Tuskegee Airman Charles McGee</strong></hi>

<p>As the first Black aviators to serve in the U.S.
         Army Air Corps, the Tuskegee Airmen broke through a massive segregation barrier
          in the<em> American military</em>. Their success and heroism during World War II,<br>
           fighting Germans in the skies over Europe, shattered pervasive stereotypes
            that African Americans had neither the character nor the aptitude for combat.<br>
             And their achievements laid crucial groundwork for
              civil rights progress in the decades to come.</p>
              
        <p>In the summer of 1939, President Franklin D.<br>
         Roosevelt signed the Civilian Pilot Training Program Act to train civilian aviators
          at colleges and vocational schools in preparation for a national emergency.<br>
           The law contained a provision that <br>
           “none of the benefits of training or programs shall be denied on account of race, creed, or color.”
            At the time,
            there were only 124 licensed Black pilots in the United States—and none in the Army Air Corps</p>
        
       <p> Of six historically Black colleges and universities included in the program,
         the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama became the most renowned. In January 1941,
          the War Department, under pressure from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
           to include Black aviators, established at Tuskegee the nation’s first Black flying unit:
            the 99 th Pursuit Squadron, which was later renamed the 99th Fighter Squadron. </p>
